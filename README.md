# Tip Calculator
____

This is a tip calculator program that I worked on as a class assignment. It calculates the tip for ones server after dining in a resturant.

If you want to run the script, you can do so via a GitHub Codespace. Here are the directions to run the code 

```bash
$ python3 tip.py
```

... and then press enter.

Here is some sample output.

```
$ python tip.py
How much was the meal? 15.00
What percentage would you like to tip? 10
Leave $1.50
```
